Before you start your node, you'll need to specify the city you're in. We currently only support 27 cities. If you're not in one of those cities then just choose the closest one. You'll still win the validator election until competition gets more serious. Your validator is measured upon your latency of those cities so as long as no-one in that city is running a node and you're relatively close by you should still win the speed of light perf tests.

So first thing we're going to do is get you a public private key pair for your validator node. We'll store that locally for you so everytime you start up your node it will use the same key.

Then we load up the config for Genesis, Storage and Validator. Then we run the Node.
