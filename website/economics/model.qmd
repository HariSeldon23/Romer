    current_usage = measure_network_load()
    utilization = current_usage / total_capacity

    # Compare to 50% threshold
    if utilization > 0.5:
        return (utilization - 0.5) * 100
    else:
        return (0.5 - utilization) * 100
```

## Conclusion

RØMER Chain's economic model represents a practical implementation of capacity-based blockchain economics. By anchoring the system to 50% of validator computational capacity, we create clear incentives for efficient resource utilization while maintaining network stability.

The combination of fixed computational costs, capacity-based supply adjustment, and geographic distribution creates an environment where market forces naturally drive network growth and optimization. This approach provides the predictability users need while maintaining the economic incentives required for sustainable network evolution.

Through its focus on physical capacity and market-driven growth, RØMER Chain positions itself as a platform for sustainable blockchain computation with unique stability across market cycles.
