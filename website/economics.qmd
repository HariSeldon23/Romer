## Core Economic Principles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Computation as the Product**

- Users purchase compute power
- Each operation has fixed cost
- Predictable resource pricing 
- True market commodity
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Austrian Alignment**

- Market determines value
- Natural price discovery
- No artificial scarcity
- Economic calculation enabled
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Stable Costs**

- Fixed operation pricing
- Predictable budgeting
- Business-friendly model
- Long-term planning possible
:::

## The Base Computation Threshold

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Dynamic Adjustment**

- 90-day weighted moving average
- More weight on recent usage
- Gradual daily adjustments
- ±10% maximum epoch change
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Economic Safeguards**

- Validator cost tracking
- Anti-manipulation design
- Seasonal pattern awareness
- Network security focus
:::

::::

The threshold provides a stable reference point for supply adjustment while remaining responsive to genuine market changes.

---

## Supply Dynamics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Above Base Threshold**

- Network usage exceeds baseline
- New RØMER tokens mint
- Supply expands naturally
- Market adjusts token value
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Below Base Threshold**

- Network usage below baseline
- RØMER tokens burn
- Supply contracts naturally
- Market supports token value
:::

::::

The supply mechanism maintains stable computation costs while letting market forces determine total supply.

---

## Market Participant Behavior

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Rational Traders**

- Sell during high usage
- Buy during low usage
- Profit from predictable moves
- Support system stability
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Network Users**

- Plan costs reliably
- Budget effectively
- Stable operating expenses
- Focus on value creation
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Validators**

- Predictable rewards
- Counter-cyclical income
- Sustainable operations
- Geographic incentives
:::

::::

---

## Crypto Market Cycles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bull Markets**

- Increased network activity
- Higher computation demand
- RØMER supply expands
- USD value typically falls
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bear Markets**

- Decreased network activity
- Lower computation demand
- RØMER supply contracts
- USD value typically rises
:::

::::

RØMER's counter-cyclical nature provides natural market stability.

---

## Economic Stability Mechanism

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Price Feedback**

- Market signals drive supply
- Real-time adjustments
- Natural equilibrium
- No central planning
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Supply Control**

- Automatic minting/burning
- Demand-driven changes
- No arbitrary schedules
- Market-determined supply
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Value Proposition**

- Stable compute costs
- Predictable operations
- Market efficiency
- Economic sustainability
:::

## Threshold Calculation Example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Daily Adjustment**

```python
# Weighted 90-day average
recent_weight = 0.6  # Last 30 days
mid_weight = 0.3    # 31-60 days
old_weight = 0.1    # 61-90 days

target = (recent_avg * recent_weight +
         mid_avg * mid_weight +
         old_avg * old_weight)

# Gradual adjustment
new_threshold = current + 
    (target - current) * 
    daily_rate
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Safeguards**

- Maximum 10% change per epoch
- Validator cost floor protection
- Anti-gaming time windows
- Emergency brake conditions
:::

::::

Precise, predictable adjustments maintain stability while responding to market conditions.

## Long-term Implications

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Network Effects**

- Predictable costs attract users
- Stable pricing enables growth
- Market efficiency increases
- Network value compounds
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Economic Sustainability**

- Self-balancing system
- Market-driven stability
- Validator sustainability
- Long-term viability
