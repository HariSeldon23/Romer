# Rømer Chain Tokenomics

## Core Principles

1. Stability First
- Stable and predictable compute costs
- Automatic supply elasticity
- Minimal governance intervention
- Market-driven growth

2. Austrian Economic Alignment
- Natural price discovery
- Market-based supply adjustment
- Sound money principles
- Real economic value backing

3. Validator Sustainability
- Fixed emissions reward per block
- Clear economic incentives
- No transaction fees to validators
- Aligned incentives with users

## Supply Mechanics

### Per Block Emissions
- 1 RØMER fixed emission to validators
- No direct transaction fees to validators (eliminates principal-agent problem)
- Base fee burns to offset emissions

### Dynamic Supply Elasticity
```
Per Block:
Base_Compute_Units = X
Base_Cost_Target = 0.001 RØMER per compute unit

Real-time adjustment:
If Actual_Compute > Base_Compute:
    New_Supply = (Actual_Compute - Base_Compute) * (Base_Cost_Target/Base_Compute)
    Treasury_Emission = New_Supply
```

### Supply Features
- Supply expands with genuine compute demand
- Real-time response to usage patterns
- No artificial scarcity
- Natural market adaptation

## Governance

### Periodic Base Compute Review
- Every 3 months
- Only adjusts Base_Compute_Units
- Data-driven decision process
- Gradual adjustments preferred

### Review Metrics
1. Network Utilization
- Average compute usage
- Usage patterns
- Growth trends

2. Economic Activity
- Real transaction volume
- Contract deployments
- Protocol usage

3. Market Health
- Token velocity
- Supply growth rate
- Price stability

## Initial Parameters

### Genesis Block
- Only validator emissions active and devnet and testnet rewards
- No treasury emissions until compute demand exceeds base
- Market discovery period

### Testnet Phase
- Determine initial Base_Compute_Units
- Calibrate Base_Cost_Target
- Test supply elasticity
- Validate economic model

## Security Features

### Anti-Spam Protection
- Costs tied to actual compute usage
- Can't game through simple transactions
- Natural economic barriers
- Maintains network quality

### Black Swan Handling
- Automatic supply adjustment
- Real-time cost stability
- No manual intervention needed
- Market stays functional

## Treasury

### Emissions
- Receives excess compute-driven supply
- Transparent allocation process
- Supports ecosystem growth
- Community governed

### Usage
1. Development Grants
2. Protocol Improvements
3. Ecosystem Growth
4. Community Initiatives

## Economic Properties

### Cost Stability
- Predictable compute costs
- Better for developers
- Supports adoption
- Reduces volatility

### Supply Elasticity
- Grows with real demand
- No artificial constraints
- Market-driven expansion
- Natural scaling

## Long-term Sustainability

### Validator Economics
- Predictable block rewards
- No fee dependence
- Aligned incentives
- Sustainable model

### Network Growth
- Organic expansion
- Real economic backing
- Market-driven supply
- Stable foundation

### Future Adaptability
- Simple governance model
- Clear adjustment mechanisms
- Market-responsive
- Evolution capable

This creates a robust economic system that:

- Maintains stability
- Allows natural growth
- Minimizes governance
- Follows market signals
- Supports long-term sustainability
