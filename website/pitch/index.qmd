## The Problem

Any successful blockchain faces an inevitable challenge:

::: {.incremental}
- **MEV is Inevitable** - As a chain grows, MEV opportunities emerge naturally
- **Geographic Centralization** - Current chains optimize for node count, not true decentralization
- **Inequality in MEV Extraction** - Large players dominate, creating centralization pressure
- **Misaligned Incentives** - Current solutions treat MEV as a problem rather than a core feature
:::

---

## Why Geographic Decentralization Matters

::: {.incremental}
- Speed of light creates immutable constraints on network topology
- Physical infrastructure can't be faked or virtualized
- True resilience comes from geographic distribution
- Prevents capture by any single jurisdiction
:::

---

## The Current State of MEV

::: {.incremental}
- Over $1B in extracted MEV since 2020
- Centralization of MEV extraction among few players
- Growing sophistication of extraction techniques
- Increasing importance in overall blockchain economics
:::

## Introducing Rømer Chain

Built from first principles to handle MEV:

::: {.incremental}
- **Proof of Physics** - Validators selected based on network performance and geographic distribution. Physical location proved by ZK proofs.
- **Commonware Primitives** - Utilizing advanced consensus mechanisms like Simplex
- **Rollup Boost Integration** - Leveraging Flashbots' technology for efficient block building
- **Equal Reward Distribution** - Designed to prevent centralization pressure
:::

- Simplex consensus for fast cross-region messaging
- Geographic optimization at protocol level
- Secure validator communication network

**2. Proof of Physics**

- One validator per major internet exchange
- Performance-based selection process
- Required diversity in BGP paths
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**3. Reth Execution Layer**

- Rust-based EVM execution
- Advanced state management
- Full Ethereum compatibility

**4. Rollup Boost**

- 250ms "Flashblocks"
- Native revert protection
- Verifiable transaction ordering

## Tokenomics: Economic Philosophy

Our token model embodies a revolutionary approach to blockchain economics:

::: {.incremental}
- **Stability as a First-Class Citizen**
  - Predictable compute costs
  - Dynamic supply adaptation
  - Minimal governance intervention

- **Austrian Economic Alignment**
  - Natural price discovery
  - Market-based supply adjustments
  - Sound money principles

- **Validator Sustainability**
  - Fixed block emissions
  - Clear economic incentives
  - No direct transaction fees
:::

## Tokenomics Architecture

### Core Economic Mechanics

::: {.incremental}
- **Block Emission**: 1 RØMER per block
- **Supply Elasticity**
  - Expands with genuine compute demand
  - Real-time market response
  - No artificial scarcity

- **Governance Model**
  - Quarterly base compute reviews
  - Data-driven adjustments
  - Community-focused approach
:::

## Supply Dynamics

### Compute-Driven Supply Mechanism

```python
def calculate_supply_adjustment(base_compute_units, actual_compute_units):
    BASE_COST_TARGET = 0.001  # RØMER per compute unit
    
    if actual_compute_units > base_compute_units:
        new_supply = (actual_compute_units - base_compute_units) * 
                     (BASE_COST_TARGET / base_compute_units)
        return new_supply
    return 0
```

::: {.incremental}
- Adaptive supply based on network usage
- Prevents artificial inflation
- Maintains economic stability
