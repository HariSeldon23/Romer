## The Problem

Current blockchain architectures face fundamental challenges:

::: {.incremental}
- **Geographic Centralization** - Existing chains optimize for node count rather than true physical decentralization
- **High Validator Barriers** - Proof of Work and Proof of Stake create massive financial barriers to participation
- **Unstable Computation Costs** - No blockchain provides predictable, Austrian economics-aligned pricing for compute
- **MEV as a Market Distortion** - Current chains treat MEV as a feature rather than a fundamental economic flaw
:::

## Why Geographic Decentralization Matters

::: {.incremental}
- Speed of light creates immutable constraints on network topology
- Physical infrastructure can't be faked or virtualized
- True resilience comes from geographic distribution
- Prevents capture by any single jurisdiction
- Creates natural DDoS resistance through physical separation
:::

---

## The Current State of Blockchain Economics

::: {.incremental}
- Volatile and unpredictable computation costs
- High barriers to entry for network participation
- Centralization pressure from economies of scale
- Lack of sound money principles in system design
- Transaction ordering becoming a purchasable commodity
:::

## Introducing Rømer Chain

Built from first principles to solve these core challenges:

::: {.incremental}
- **Proof of Physics** - Validators selected based on network performance and geographic distribution, with physical location proved by ZK proofs
- **Commonware Primitives** - Utilizing advanced consensus mechanisms like Simplex for optimal cross-region performance
- **Sui Object Model** - Leveraging Move's resource-oriented programming for precise compute cost calculation
- **Austrian Economic Design** - Fixed computation costs with market-driven supply adjustment

## Supply Dynamics

### Market-Responsive Supply Mechanism

```python
def calculate_supply_adjustment(base_compute_units, actual_compute_units):
    BASE_COST_TARGET = 0.001  # RØMER per compute unit
    
    if actual_compute_units > base_compute_units:
        new_supply = (actual_compute_units - base_compute_units) * 
                     (BASE_COST_TARGET / base_compute_units)
        return new_supply
    
    # Supply contraction during low demand
    contraction_rate = base_compute_units / actual_compute_units
    return -1 * (BASE_COST_TARGET * contraction_rate)
```

::: {.incremental}
- Bidirectional supply adjustment
- Natural market equilibrium
- Automatic price stability
