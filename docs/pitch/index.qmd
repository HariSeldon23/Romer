## The Problem

Any successful blockchain faces an inevitable challenge:

::: {.incremental}
- **MEV is Inevitable** - As a chain grows, MEV opportunities emerge naturally
- **Geographic Centralization** - Current chains optimize for node count, not true decentralization
- **Inequality in MEV Extraction** - Large players dominate, creating centralization pressure
- **Misaligned Incentives** - Current solutions treat MEV as a problem rather than a core feature
:::

---

## Why Geographic Decentralization Matters

::: {.incremental}
- Speed of light creates immutable constraints on network topology
- Physical infrastructure can't be faked or virtualized
- True resilience comes from geographic distribution
- Prevents capture by any single jurisdiction
:::

---

## The Current State of MEV

::: {.incremental}
- Over $1B in extracted MEV since 2020
- Centralization of MEV extraction among few players
- Growing sophistication of extraction techniques
- Increasing importance in overall blockchain economics

## Introducing Rømer Chain

Built from first principles to handle MEV:

::: {.incremental}
- **Proof of Physics** - Validators selected based on network performance and geographic distribution. Physical location proved by ZK proofs.
- **Commonware Primitives** - Utilizing advanced consensus mechanisms like Simplex
- **Rollup Boost Integration** - Leveraging Flashbots' technology for efficient block building
- **Equal Reward Distribution** - Designed to prevent centralization pressure

## Technical Architecture

Our stack combines four powerful technologies:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**1. Commonware Primitives**

- Simplex consensus for fast cross-region messaging
- Geographic optimization at protocol level
- Secure validator communication network

**2. Proof of Physics**

- One validator per major internet exchange
- Performance-based selection process
- Required diversity in BGP paths
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**3. Reth Execution Layer**

- Rust-based EVM execution
- Advanced state management
- Full Ethereum compatibility

**4. Rollup Boost**

- 250ms "Flashblocks"
- Native revert protection
- Verifiable transaction ordering

## Tokenomics: Core Principles

Our token model embodies cypherpunk values:

::: {.incremental}
- No venture capital funding
- Community-driven development
- Merit-based contribution rewards
- Progressive decentralization
- Sustainable long-term incentives
- Public goods funding

## Token Distribution Overview

Total Supply: 1.008 billion RØMER tokens distributed across three phases:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Devnet (10%)**
Development of core validator infrastructure and protocol fundamentals
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Testnet (15%)**
Academic partnerships and infrastructure bootstrapping
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Mainnet (75%)**
Long-term network operation and growth
:::
