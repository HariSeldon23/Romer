# Rømer Chain 
"In a time of universal greed, curiosity is a revolutionary act." - Justin Trollip

## Network Overview
Rømer Chain, named after Ole Rømer who first proved light travels at a finite speed, represents a fundamental shift in blockchain security models. Instead of relying on economic stake or computational work, Rømer Chain's security is anchored in the immutable laws of physics - specifically, the speed of light and the physical reality of global network infrastructure.

The chain's consensus mechanism, Proof of Physics, leverages the unchangeable nature of light speed and network topology to ensure security. By integrating with 100 major internet exchanges and submarine cable landing points worldwide, Rømer Chain measures performance through BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) paths. These paths reveal the true network topology, making it impossible to fake geographic distribution or network performance.

Validator selection follows a deterministic epoch system where regions must complete a full cycle before repeating. Within each region, validators compete based on their network performance, infrastructure quality, and path diversity. This creates a system where the worst possible attack only results in temporary halts rather than chain forks, and executing such an attack would require controlling physical infrastructure across multiple global regions.

Uniquely, Rømer Chain requires no minimum stake to participate. Instead of economic security, it relies on the physical limitations of light speed and network infrastructure. This approach not only provides robust security but also encourages infrastructure development in emerging markets, as validators need real, high-quality network presence to participate effectively.

Through this design, Rømer Chain achieves something remarkable: a permissionless blockchain whose security derives from the fundamental constants of the universe rather than economic game theory.
